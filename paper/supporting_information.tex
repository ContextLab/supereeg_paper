\caption{\textbf{Reconstruction quality across all electrodes in two
    ECoG datasets, broken down by experiment.}
  \textbf{A. Distributions of correlations between observed versus
    reconstructed activity by electrode, for Dataset 1.}  The
  across-patient distribution (black) reflects reconstruction accuracy
  (correlation) using a correlation model learned from all but one
  patient's data, and then applied to that held-out patient's data.
  The within-patient distribution (gray) reflects performance using a
  correlation model learned from the same patient who contributed the
  to-be-reconstructed electrode.  The split violin plot displays the
  same distributions shown in Figure~\corrmaps A.
  \textbf{B. Distributions of correlations for Dataset 2.}  The split
  violin plots are in the same format as those in Panel A.  The
  leftmost plot (``Within'') displays the same distributions shown in
  Figure~\corrmaps B.  All reconstructions reflected in the
  distribution were carried out using a model trained and tested using
  data from the same experiment.  The middle plots (``Across'')
  reflect reconstructions trained and tested using data from different
  experiments.  The rightmost plot (``All'') reflect reconstructions
  obtained using models trained and tested on data from both
  experiments.  The black distributions reflect models trained and
  tested across patients (analogous to the black histograms in
  Figure~\corrmaps) and the gray distributions reflect models trained
  and tested within patient (analogous to the gray histograms in
  Figure~\corrmaps).  The dark gray significance bars reflect
  paired-sample $t$-tests comparing the ($z$-transformed)
  reconstruction accuracy for each electrode obtained within versus
  across patients.  The black significance bars reflect paired-sample
  $t$-tests comparing the across-patient reconstruction accuracies
  across datasets.  The light gray significance bars reflect
  paired-sample $t$-tests comparing the within-patient reconstruction
  accuracies across datasets.  The symbols denote the corresponding
  $p$-values of those statistical tests.}

  split the timeseries data in

  and more time samples (in 1000 sample increments).  These time
  samples were either drawn randomly (``Random'') , or were drawn sequentially from
  either the closest timepoint (``Close'' ) or the furthest timepoint
  (``Apart'' ). The two correlation matrices were then correlated, and the

using more and more patients. The two correlation matrices were then correlated, and the
  coefficient plotted relative to the number of patients included.
