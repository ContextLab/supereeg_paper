\caption{\textbf{Reconstruction quality for Datasets 1 and 2.}
  \textbf{A. Distributions of correlations between observed versus
    reconstructed activity by electrode, for Dataset 1.} The split
  violin plot reflects the same data as Figure~3A, presented here for
  comparison.  \textbf{B. Distributions of correlation between
    observed versus reconstructed activity by electrode, for Dataset
    2.}  The left-most split violin plot (``Within'') reflects the
  same data as Figure~3B, presented here for comparison.  The
  ``Across'' plot reflects the same analyses, but limited to models
  that were trained and tested on \textit{different} Dataset 2
  experiments.  The ``All'' plot reflects the same analyses, but
  including models that were trained and tested on both of the Dataset
  2 experiments.  All plots: the dark gray distributions denote
  across-subject correlations (model trained on all but one patient
  and tested on the held-out patient), and the medium gray
  distributions denote within-subject correlations (model trained on
  all but one electrode from one patient, and tested on the held-out
  electrode).  The horizontal bars denote $t$-tests between the
  corresponding distributions (after $z$-transforming the
  correlations), and the white numbers reflect the distribution means.
  The symbols denote the corresponding $p$-values of those statistical
  tests.}

\caption{\textbf{Reconstruction quality for Dataset 2,
    Experiments 1 and 2.} \textbf{A. Distributions of correlations
    between observed versus reconstructed activity by electrode, for
    Experiment 1.}  Each split violin plot and horizontal bar is in
  the same format as the plots in Figure~\ref{fig:supplemental_1}.
  ``Within'' denotes within-subject correlations (model trained on all
  but one electrode from one patient, and tested on the held-out
  electrode); ``Across'' denotes across-subject correlations (model
  trained an all but one patient and tested on the held-out patient);
  ``All'' denotes a model trained on all data from all patients,
  except for one held-out electrode (and tested on the held-out
  electrode).  \textbf{B. Distributions of correlations between
    observed versus reconstructed activity by electrode, for
    Experiment 2.}  All of the plots and bars are in the same format
  as those in Panel A.}

\caption{\textbf{Reconstruction quality across all electrodes in two
      Dataset 2 experiments.}  \textbf{A. Distributions of correlations
      between observed versus reconstructed activity by electrode, for
      Experiment 1.}  Same format as Figure~3A and B, but reflects data shown
    in Figure~\ref{fig:supplemental_2}A (leftmost violin plot).
 \textbf{B. Distributions of correlations
      between observed versus reconstructed activity by electrode, for
      Experiment 2.}  Same format as Figure~3A and B, but reflects
    data shown in Figure~\ref{fig:supplemental_2}B (leftmost violin
    plot).  \textbf{C.--D.  Reconstruction
      performance by location.} Each dot reflects the location of a
    single implanted electrode from Dataset 2, Experiment 1 (Panel C)
    or Dataset 2, Experiment 2 (Panel D).  The dot colors denote the
    average within-experiment (across-session)
    correlation, using the across-patient correlation model, between
    the observed and reconstructed activity at the given electrode
    location projected to the cortical surface~\citep{CombEtal19}.}

  accuracy for each frequency. \textbf{C.~Terms associated with most informative
